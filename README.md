# Project Description

The Paydock Android MobileSDK seamlessly integrates with Paydock services to easily build a payments
flow in your Android app. The SDK provides a customisable experience with pre-built UI widgets that
handle and support various payment methods.

Once you have setup and initialised the MobileSDK in your application, you can use the MobileSDK
widgets to access payment flows. These include interacting with GooglePay and Paypal. You can also
complete 3DS challenges, capture addresses, securely collect gift card details, and tokenise card
details.
